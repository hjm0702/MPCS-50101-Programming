# Problem 4. Answer the following questions.


# A. What is the time complexity of bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion
# sort?


# B. Suppose you have the following list of numbers to sort:
# [19, 1, 9, 7, 3, 10, 13, 15, 8, 12]
#
# Write out the list that represents the partially sorted list after three
# complete passes of "bubble sort"?
#
#
# For reference, the pseudocode for an implementation of the buble_sort
# algorithm is shown below.   You do not need to complete the implementation.
#
# def bubble_sort(items):
#     """ Implementation of bubble sort """
#     for i in range(len(items)):
#         for j in range(len(items)-1-i):
#             if items[j] > items[j+1]:
#                 # Swap the items
