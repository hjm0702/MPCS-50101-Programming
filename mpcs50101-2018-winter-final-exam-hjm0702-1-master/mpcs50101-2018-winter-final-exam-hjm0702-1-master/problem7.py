# Problem 7
#
#
# A. Construct a program that prompts a user for word and determines if that
# word is a valid play in a Scrabble match.  Implement a linear search algorithm
# to detect if the word is valid by comparing it to the [list of allowed Scrabble words](scrabble_list.txt).
#
# Time your function and return it as part of the results.
#
# The program flow should be similar to this:
# % python problem3.py
# What is the word? qi
#
# Valid! (Found in 0.2 seconds)




# B. Faced with this large unsorted list, would it be more efficient to sort the
# list first and then perform a binary search, or to just use a linear search?
# Explain your answer in terms of algorithm complexity.



# C. Since our list of Scrabble words will not change very much over time, it
# may be possible to consider the size as constant.  If this is the case, how
# would this change your answer in B.
