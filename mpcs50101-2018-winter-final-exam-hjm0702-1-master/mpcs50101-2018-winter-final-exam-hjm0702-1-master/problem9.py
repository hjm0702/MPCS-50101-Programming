# Problem 9
#
#
# Write a function that removes duplicates from an unsorted
# linked list.   Your solution should use your own
# linked list implementation.

# Show an example of you function in action using the
# following list:
#
#   10, 12, 11, 11, 12, 11, 10
#
# After processing, the resulting list should become:
#   10, 12, 11
