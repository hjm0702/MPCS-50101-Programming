# Problem 8
#
# A) Provide an example of operator overloading implemented in one of Python's
# built-in data types.



# B) Construct a class to implement the abstract data type `Circle`.  The
# `Circle` class should have an attributes named `radius`, `circumference` and
# `area`.  To create an instance of `Circle` write a custom initialization
# function that takes the radius as an argument.  All of the objects attributes
# should be assigned values in the initialization function.
#
# Overload the greater-than and less-than comparision operators to allow
# comparison between `Circle` objects based on their radius.  A `Circle` object
# with a larger radius should be evaluated as greater.  Override the `__str__`
# method to print information about the circle in the following format:
#
#        Cirlce: radius X, circumference Y, area Z



# C) Provide a code snippet that creates `Circle` objects that shows
# the comparison operators in use.
