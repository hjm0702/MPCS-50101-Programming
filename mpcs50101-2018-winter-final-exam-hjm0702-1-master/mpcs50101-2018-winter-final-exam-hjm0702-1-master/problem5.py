# Problem 5
#
# Write a function that takes an unsorted list of integers called `number_list`
# and an integer called `target_sum` as  arguments and return a boolean value
# indicating whether there are two distinct items in `number_list` that sum
# to `target_sum`.
#

# Full credit will be awarded for solving in O(n) time, half-credit for
# O(n * logn) time, one-third credit for O(n^2) time.

def thats_sum_function(number_list, target_sum):
    # Your code here



# Provide code snippets that show your function in use for both a true and false
# case similar to the following:

print thats_sum_function([1,2,3,4], 6) # True
print thats_sum_function([70,20,30,80], 100) # True
print thats_sum_function([1,3,3,4], 6) # False
print thats_sum_function([1,2,3,4], 10) # False
