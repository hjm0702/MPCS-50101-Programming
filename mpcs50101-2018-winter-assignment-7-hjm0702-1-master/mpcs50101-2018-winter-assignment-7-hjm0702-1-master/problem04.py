- Assignment 2, problem 1:
  - O(1) The algorithm has to calculate a temperater and print it regardless of any factor.

- Assignment 2, problem 5:
  - O(N) The algorithm has to sum or substract each digit of the number into "Total".

- Assignment 2, problem 7:
  - O(N) The algorithm has to print a line n times.

  - Assignment 3, problem 3 (encrypt & decrypt):
  - O(N) The algorithm has to process encrypting or decrypting prosseses by each letter.

- Assignment 3, problem 5:
  - O(N) The algorithm has to process a decrypting process by each letter,
    and after the process, it has to find each word from the word list.

- Assignment 4, problem 3:
  - O(N^K) , K = The number of layers of subdirectories a dicrectory contains
    The algorithm is recursive. So, Big O depends on how many time the recursive function run,
    and it will eventually run as many times as the number of the layers of subdirectories under the directory.
