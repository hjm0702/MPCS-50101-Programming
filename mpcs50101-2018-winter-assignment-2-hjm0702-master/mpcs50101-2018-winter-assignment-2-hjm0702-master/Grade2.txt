Assignment 2:

Problem 1: .5/1
Works, but there are some issues:
- .25 for not using a function to convert temperature
- .25 for not handling incorrect user input

Problem 2: .5/1
- .25 for not handling user input
- .25 for not using a function

Problem 3: 1/2
So technically, this will work but the code is very inefficient. You want to
avoid nesting for loops overmuch as it increases the run time exponentially.
- .5 for stylistic problems
- .5 for not using a function, handling spaces

Problem 4: .75/1
- .25 for printing rather than returning a value

Problem 5: .25/1
- .25 for not handling user input
- .25 for not using a function
- .25 because you shouldn't be using modulus - how could you continue the function
in the same vein?

Problem 6: .25/1
- .25 for not using a function
- .5 because it doesn't handle spaces, punctuation, or capitalization

Problem 7: 1/1
Good!

Problem 8: .75/2
- 1 because it crashes if you try to say you want to play again twice
- .25 because of stylistic concerns: try to avoid using so many nested if
statements!

Total: 5/10
