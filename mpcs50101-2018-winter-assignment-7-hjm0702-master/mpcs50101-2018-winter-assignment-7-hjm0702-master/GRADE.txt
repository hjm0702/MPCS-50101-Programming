  - Selecting the next best move in Tic Tac Toe is O(1), because there will always be a constant number of moves.
  - Compiling a telephone or address book from a list of names/numbers can be improved on O(n^2) by using sorting algorithms such as merge or quick sort, which would be O(n log n).
  - Determining if a number is odd or even would be O(1), because there are a constant number of choices

  Your `gcd_euclid` function looks good, but try to narrow down your base cases! The `gcd_repeated_substraction` shouldn't require creating a list variable, and any variables should be local to each function.

  Program should present the top 20 articles in both search and top headline mode.
  The `news()` function is much too complex, which makes it difficult to debug. One more obvious improvement would be to create a separate function for creating the URL string. In this function, you could add constants to the base API url, any endpoints, and the API key.
  There's also some repetition of code involving printing the JSON responses -- this would be another place that having a separate function to do this would be useful.
  Also, be careful with spacing and indentation; with the `raw_input` function calls, the spacing is a bit all over the place.
