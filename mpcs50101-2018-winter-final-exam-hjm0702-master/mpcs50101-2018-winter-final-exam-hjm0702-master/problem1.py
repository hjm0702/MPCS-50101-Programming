# Problem 1
#
# A) Sort the following complexities from in increasing order:
#   O(n^3), O(n), O(logn), O(1), O(n*logn), O(n^2), O((n^2)*logn)

    O(1) < O(logn)< O(n)< O(n*logn) < O(n^2) < O((n^2)*logn) < O(n^3)


# B) Provide a justification for choosing an algorithm with a
# greater time complexity provided they both perform the
# required functionality.
  If data set is small enough and algorithm is easier to understand, we can choose an algorithm with a greater time complexity.
