  The idea here is to isolate any words sorting/scoring functionality to the `words` module, while other functionality should be put in a `main()` function (or other functions if needed) within the `problem1` file.
  `sorting` function does more than the name indicates. This function should be broken up into several functions, perhaps for reading/writing to a file, scoring the words, and scoring the words.
  `tile_score` should be a constant within the `main()` function, instead of a global variable.

  `re` should only be imported once, at the top of the file.

  Looks like you were on the right track, but your program prints only a list with each letter of the user input.
  The regex on line 30 is quite complicated, is there a way it could be simplified? Perhaps by searching for only letters instead of a specific pattern?
  There's a mix of script code, function definitions, and commented out code in this file the makes your program a bit difficult to read.
  `tile_score` dictionary definition is floating in the middle of the file -- should be defined as constant in a `main()` function.
