Assignment 6

1) .25/2
Okay, as you pointed out this isn't quite there. You should use an Initialization
function for each class which creates the attributes that can be passed into and
out of a class. This will help your classes interact with one another.

2) .75/2
You've got a lot of the right idea here, but the add, subtract, lt (etc) functions
should override the addition, subraction... (etc) functions. In order to do this,
they should be part of the class definition and use the overriding syntax we discussed
in class.

3) .5/2
The bones of the problem are here, but it crashes if you ask for another question.
You should also:
- Import your fractions class from the 2nd problem
- Override the __eq__ function so you can test for equality - right now you can't
determine if they are equal easily
- Modularize the heck out of your game - one function to generate a problem, another
to test...etc.

4) .5/1 => 1/1
This works correctly, but your code should all (but like two lines) be within
your countdown timer class. Try writing an init function that gets and validates user
input and a method that does the countdown.

5) .25/1 => 1/1
Right now this doesn't run as you are missing the import statement. You also need
to generate random points for the plot - look in to the random module.

6) 1/2
First of all, the Task class needs an init function that gets all of the attributes
sorted. You should consider how you will generate a unique ID as it is a non-trivial
problem. You also should consider how your will save and access tasks and in what format.
Finally, it would probably be a good idea to have a separate Task Manager class that
organizes the Tasks.


TOTAL: 3.25/10 => 3.875/10
