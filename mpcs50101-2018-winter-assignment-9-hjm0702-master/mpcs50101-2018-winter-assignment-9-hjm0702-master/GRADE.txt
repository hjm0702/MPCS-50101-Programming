  Good! Remember to wrap ALL your code in functions. There shouldn't be any floating global variables or function calls.

  Great job overall! However, there is a lot of code and nested `if` statements underneath your `if __name__ == '__main__' statements. Another class (maybe TaskManager?) might be helpful in reducing some of the complexity there.
