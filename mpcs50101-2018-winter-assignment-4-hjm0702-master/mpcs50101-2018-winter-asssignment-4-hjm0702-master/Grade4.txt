Assignment 4:

- Must use docstrings!

1) 0/2 => 2/2
You should have included the unit testing for this problem. If you are having trouble,
consider making a function for converting temperature to test and another for getting user
input.

2) 0/1
REGRADE: While this is a little bit closer, you still aren't returning anything with
the recursive call and there are some syntactic errors that prevent this from running.

You have some of the right ideas here, but part of what you are missing is that you need
to return the recursive call to the function.
Also, you should consider that if a == b at the end of the recursion, then it actually
is a power.

3) .5/1 (RECURSIVE) => 1/1
Good work! You find all the hidden subdirectories which is great, although
the print out ends up a little off.
This is the output for the test in the assignment:
home
   file1.txt
   file2.txt
 photos /
   .DS_Store
 favorites /
   beach1.png
   hawaii.png
     photo1.jpg
     photo2.jpg
You also want to validate that there is an argument passed via command line.

4) 1/1
Good work!

5) 1.25/2 => 2/2
Great! A couple of small issues:
1) Your mean function falls prey to integer division - the value you return gets
rounded down. Since you use the same function in your variance, you have the same
issue there.
2) The mode should return no mode if there isn't one most common value.
3) You should write this such that it can be imported directly into the test file and
validate the argument input. This could be done by putting it within the main loop
and then validating.

6) .75/1 => 1/1
Nice work! Especially with handling the mode.
My only comment would be that you might want to hardcode some test cases rather
than asking for user input.


7) 1.75/2 => 2/2
Great work!
You definitely want to make this handle uppercase letters, however.
That could be achieved by using .lower() and .isalpha().


TOTAL: 5.25/10 => 7.125/10
