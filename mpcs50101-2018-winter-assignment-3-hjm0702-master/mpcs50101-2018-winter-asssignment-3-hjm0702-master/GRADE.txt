  Make sure to enclose the main driver logic of your program within a `main` function.
  Please also make sure to include any files that are necessary for your programs to run.

1. (1/1)
  Nice work!

2. (0.5/1)
  This program should utilize a `while` loop so that your program will continue to ask for user input if the input is invalid.
  Output to user should use string formatting.
  I was able to break your program by triggering an `EOFError` (i.e., hitting Ctrl + D).

3. (1.25/2)
  Program breaks if the message contains lowercase characters, due to the way you're defining the range of possible letters on line 1.
  The letter `Z` with a key shift of 1 is encrypted as `B`, instead of `A`.

4. (0.5/1)
  Function should open the filename passed in as an argument. You have hardcoded `common_words_100.txt` in your function.
  Please include the `.txt` for us to test.
  File name is incorrect, currently printing the file object.
  Words should be sorted in alphabetical order, however capital letters are out of order (see: `I`).

5. (1/2)
  The idea for this problem was to loop from 1-26 to try all potential keys, checking each decrypted word against the `common_words` file.
  Looks like you were on the right track, and you did print the correct message, but there is no evidence that your function helped produce that answer. 
  There is also no evidence of using the `common_words` file.

6. (0.75/1)
  You should not be hardcoding the answers, but instead should call functions you have written in order to print the answers. 
  Otherwise, it's not immediately obvious to me if your programs are working.
  Please include the `points.txt` file.

7. (1/2)
  The function that uses iteration should not use `min` or `max` functions.

8. (0.5/2)
  There is a syntax error on line 30 involving the `range` function that breaks your program.
  Problem asks you to print the top 20 words, not the entire dictionary of words!
