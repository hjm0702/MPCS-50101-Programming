4) 9.5/10
Really good! You just have an integer division error in your volume function.
Try changing 4/3 to 4/3.0. :)

Very good!
I would say that it might make more sense to get user input within a function
and also you should format the dollars to have two decimal places.

6) 6.5/15
You are on the right track and the psuedocode you wrote should work out!
Good job!
Just as a note, to open the file use:
f = f.open('3_letter_words.txt')
Also, make sure you use a separate words module (i.e. word.py as a separate file)
and then import


TOTAL: 34.0/50
